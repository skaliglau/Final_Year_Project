# A Data Mining Framework to Analyze Road Accident Data | Final_Year_Project

## Problem Statement

Road and traffic accidents are uncertain and unpredictable incidents and their analysis requires the
knowledge of the factors affecting them. Road and traffic accidents are defined by a set of variables which
are mostly of a discrete nature. The major problem in the analysis of accident data is its heterogeneous
nature. Thus heterogeneity must be considered during the analysis of the data otherwise, some
relationship between the data may remain hidden. Although researchers used segmentation of the data
to reduce this heterogeneity using some measures such as expert knowledge, there is no guaranteethat
this will lead to an optimal segmentation which consists of homogeneous groups of road accidents.
Therefore, cluster analysis can assist the segmentation of road accidents.


## About the Project:  
This is a research based data analysis project in which we try to analyze a large data set not capable of being analyzed by typical database or data analysis software like Excel.  To overcome this, we try to implement distributed processing using Hadoop and pipe the result with Apache Zeppelin to analyze and visualize the data set and generate a decision tree. 

## Tools required:
### Hardware Requirements:
* Processor Type:  Intel Core I5-8250u CPU  
* Processor Speed: 1.8 Ghz  
* Hard Disk: 1 Tb  â€¢ Ram: 8 Gb  
 
### Software Requirements:
* Operating System: Windows 10 
* Front End: Apache Zeppelin 
* Back End: Scala-Spark
