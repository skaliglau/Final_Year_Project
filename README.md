# A Data Mining Framework to Analyze Road Accident Data | Final_Year_Project

## Problem Statement

Road and traffic accidents are uncertain and unpredictable incidents and their analysis requires the
knowledge of the factors affecting them. Road and traffic accidents are defined by a set of variables which
are mostly of a discrete nature. The major problem in the analysis of accident data is its heterogeneous
nature. Thus heterogeneity must be considered during the analysis of the data otherwise, some
relationship between the data may remain hidden. Although researchers used segmentation of the data
to reduce this heterogeneity using some measures such as expert knowledge, there is no guaranteethat
this will lead to an optimal segmentation which consists of homogeneous groups of road accidents.
Therefore, cluster analysis can assist the segmentation of road accidents.
